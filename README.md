# Bartlett_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Our Project is to make an address book That will store the contacts into a text file.
Storing the file will make it so that the contacts that are added will be persistant.
The contacts will be stored in a doubly linked list.

**Functions:**

- Add Contact
- Remove Contact
- Edit Contact
- Find Contact
- Print Contacts
- Group create
- Group Contacts
- Print Groups
- Remove Group
- Add Favorite
- Remove Favorite
- Print Favorites

**How to compile with make file**

- Download main.cpp, AddressBook.cpp, AddressBook.h, and Makefile
- Move all the files to the same directory
- Goto the folder with the terminal
- Type "make" to compile the program
- To run type "./main"
- Type "make clean" to clean the directory (Removes main and all .a and .o files)

**Requests for Phase 3 of the project**
- Added_Contacts.txt is not adding any of the contacts in the file to the linked list
- When trying to print the contact's group name it shows up as blank
- Add any function that would improve the program
- edit any of the function to improve the program
